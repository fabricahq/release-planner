# Prepare a release

This repository publishes releases with [Release Planner](https://github.com/fabricahq/release-planner) v0.5.0. Print its release procedure and follow it:

```sh
release-planner guide
```

First check that `release-planner version` prints `v0.5.0`. If it doesn't, or `release-planner` isn't installed, install that version:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabricahq/release-planner/v0.5.0/install.sh | sh -s -- --version v0.5.0
```

Read `.release-planner/policy.md` first for this repository's release policy. You prepare the release pull request; the maintainer approves the release by merging it. Never tag, publish, or merge.
